# Queue #

This code implements a simple menu system and calls methods for an as-yet unwritten Queue class. Copy it to a new project and attempt to implement the Queue class using an array.

Your Queue class only needs to work with integers.

Start with a simple linear queue. Once that is working, modify it to work as a circular queue.
